## LLM Text Classifier with Prompt Engineering

Built a few-shot LLM sentiment classification pipeline using a quantized Phi-2 model, achieving efficient GPU inference and end-to-end evaluation on a IMDB dataset of 50,000 movie reviews.

Achieved 86% accuracy in correctly classifying sentiment across the sample of movie reviews, with errors concentrated in ambiguous or mixed-sentiment reviews.

Measured model accuracy and runtime performance, performing error analysis on misclassified examples to assess few-shot reliability.

Project was built in conjunction with instruction provided by Nachiketa Hebbar
